The scene should feature: layered particle systems simulating floating dust motes and light rays filtering through a forest canopy, animated geometry or instanced meshes representing foliage and tree silhouettes in deep greens and warm earthy browns, soft dappled light effects using point lights or directional lights with gentle animation, and a color palette of rich forest greens (#2d5a27, #4a7c59, #1a3a1a), warm earthy browns (#6b4423, #8b6914), and soft golden light accents (#d4a843, #f0e68c at low opacity). The animation should loop continuously and subtly without being distracting. All existing hero text, CTA buttons, and overlay content must remain readable and properly z-indexed above the 3D canvas.",
