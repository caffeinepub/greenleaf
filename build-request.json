      "text": "Replace the full-screen ocean waves video hero background on the Home page with an immersive Three.js/React Three Fiber animated forest scene. The scene should feature: layered particle systems simulating floating dust motes and light rays filtering through a forest canopy, animated geometry or instanced meshes representing foliage and tree silhouettes in deep greens and warm earthy browns, soft dappled light effects using point lights or directional lights with gentle animation, and a color palette of rich forest greens (#2d5a27, #4a7c59, #1a3a1a), warm earthy browns (#6b4423, #8b6914), and soft golden light accents (#d4a843, #f0e68c at low opacity). The animation should loop continuously and subtly without being distracting. All existing hero text, CTA buttons, and overlay content must remain readable and properly z-indexed above the 3D canvas.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The ocean waves video element is fully removed from the Home page hero section",
        "A Three.js/React Three Fiber canvas fills the full-screen hero area as the background",
        "The scene renders visible animated particles (dust motes or light rays) with soft golden/amber coloring",
        "Foliage or tree silhouette elements in deep greens and earthy browns are visible in the scene",
        "Gentle ambient animation loops continuously without hard resets or stutters",
        "The color palette uses forest greens, warm browns, and soft golden light accents",
        "All hero overlay text (headline, subheadline, CTA buttons) remains fully readable on top of the 3D background",
        "The canvas is responsive and fills the viewport on mobile, tablet, and desktop",
        "Performance is acceptable — animation runs at a smooth frame rate on modern devices",
        "No external video files or network requests are required for the background"

  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts, frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts, frontend/src/main.tsx, or frontend/src/components/ui",
    "Do not alter the backend — no backend changes are needed for this feature",
    "Preserve all existing hero section content (headline, tagline, CTA buttons, scroll indicator) above the new background",
    "The animated background must not require any external video files or CDN-hosted assets"

  "nonGoals": [
    "Changing any other page backgrounds or sections beyond the Home page hero",
    "Adding sound or audio to the forest scene",
    "Replacing the LoadingLandingPage animation",
