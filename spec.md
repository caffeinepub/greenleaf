# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the full-screen ocean waves video background on the Home page hero with an animated Three.js/React Three Fiber forest scene that fits the plant shop aesthetic.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the ocean waves video element from the Home page hero section
- Add a full-screen Three.js/React Three Fiber canvas as the hero background
- Implement layered particle systems simulating floating dust motes and light rays with soft golden/amber coloring
- Add animated foliage and tree silhouette elements using deep greens (#2d5a27, #4a7c59, #1a3a1a) and warm earthy browns (#6b4423, #8b6914)
- Add soft dappled light effects with gentle continuous looping animation using golden light accents (#d4a843, #f0e68c)
- Ensure all existing hero overlay content (headline, subheadline, CTA buttons, scroll indicator) remains readable and z-indexed above the 3D canvas
- Make the canvas responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

**User-visible outcome:** The Home page hero now displays an immersive, looping animated forest scene with floating particles, foliage silhouettes, and warm dappled light instead of the ocean waves video, while all existing hero text and buttons remain fully visible and usable.
