  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/LoadingLandingPage.tsx to implement a createMaskedLeafCanvas function that uses an offscreen canvas with a radial gradient mask and 'destination-in' composite operation to remove the white background from floating leaf particles. The canvas uses ctx.clearRect for transparent clearing. This directly addresses REQ-1's requirement to remove the white background from leaf particles on the canvas. No constrained files were modified. No hallucinated features are evident.",
